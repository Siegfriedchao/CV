abstract = {The generation of computer-generated holograms (CGHs) requires a significant amount of computational power. To accelerate the process, highly parallel field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are deemed to be a promising computing platform to implement non-iterative hologram generation algorithms. In this paper, we present a cost-optimized heterogeneous FPGA architecture based on a one-step phase retrieval algorithm for CGH generation. The results indicate that our hardware implementation is 2.5{\{}$\backslash$texttimes{\}} faster than the equivalent software implementation on a personal computer with a high-end multi-core CPU. Trade-offs between cost and performance are demonstrated, and we show that the proposed heterogeneous architecture can be used in a compact display system that is cost and size optimized.},

abstract = {We present an implementation of the One-Step Phase-Retrieval (OSPR) algorithm for computer-generated holography (CGH) using a digital signal processor (DSP). Typically, personal computers with powerful graphics processing units and field programmable gate arrays are used for hologram generation. Such systems, however, are of high-cost and usually not suitable for embedded applications. We use a Texas Instrument TMDXEVM6678LE evaluation module carrying a TMS320C6678 eight-core DSP to evaluate the implementation performance. We implement a fast generation method based on OSPR and demonstrate both binary-phase and multi-level-phase generation results. We evaluate the performance of the DSP implementation and compare it to that of a personal computer. We also project the generated hologram with a lab-based projection system. The results show that, although our DSP board has a performance that is on average slower than a modern six-core central processing unit, an embedded DSP for CGH due to its low-power, low-cost and minimal profile is promising.},

abstract = {Computer Generated Holograms (CGHs) are fundamental to the creation of holographic display and are responsible for carrying the phase or amplitude information of a particular optical field. The standard approaches for CGH generation on personal computers all involve multiple forward and inverse 2-dimensional fast Fourier Transforms (2D FFTs). This common method is not fast enough for a real-time application. Producing CGHs via configurable hardware may reduce the computational burden. To reduce overhead, fixed-point arithmetic is usually implemented; however, this sacrifices the precision of the algorithm. Care needs to be taken when applying fixed-point operations.In this paper, we present a radix-2 error propagation model to analyses the 2D FFT based on three different rounding methods and we also show the simulation results on selection of appropriate rounding methods.},

@article{Wang2019,
abstract = {We present a new method for deriving functions that model the relationship between multiple signals in a physical system. The method, which we call dimensional function synthesis, applies to data streams where the dimensions of the signals are known. The method comprises two phases: a compile-time synthesis phase and a subsequent calibration using sensor data. We implement dimensional function synthesis and use the implementation to demonstrate efficiently summarizing multi-modal sensor data for two physical systems using 90 laboratory experiments and 10 000 synthetic idealized measurements. We evaluate the performance of the compile-time phase of dimensional function synthesis as well as the calibration phase overhead, inference latency, and accuracy of the models our method generates. The results show that our technique can generate models in less than 300 ms on average across all the physical systems we evaluated. When calibrated with sensor data, our models outperform traditional regression and neural network models in inference accuracy in all the cases we evaluated. In addition, our models perform better in training latency (over 8660× improvement) and required arithmetic operations in inference (over 34× improvement). These significant gains are largely the result of exploiting information on the physics of signals that has hitherto been ignored.},

@article{Wang2018,
abstract = {This paper reports on a low-cost turbidity sensor design for continuous on-line water quality monitoring applications. The measurement of turbidity by agricultural and environmental scientists is restricted by the current cost and functionality of available commercial instruments. Although there are a number of low-cost turbidity sensors exploited within domestic 'white-goods', such as dishwashers, the lack of sensitivity, and power-usage of these devices make them unsuitable for fresh-water quality monitoring purposes. The recent introduction of wireless protocols and hardware, associated with the 'Internet-of-Things' concept for machine-to-machine autonomous sensing and control, has enabled the large-scale networked intelligent water turbidity monitoring system that implements relatively low-cost sensors to be developed. The proposed sensor uses both transmitted light and orthogonal (90 degrees) scattered light detection principles, and is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower in cost compared to the existing commercial turbidity sensors. With an 850-nm infrared LED, and dual orthogonal photodetectors, the proposed design is capable of measuring turbidity within the range of 0-1000 Nephelometric Turbidity Unit (NTU) with improved accuracy and robustness as compared with the existing low cost turbidity sensors. The combination of orthogonal and transmitted light detection unit provides both 0-200 NTU high resolution and accuracy sensing and 0-1000 NTU lower resolution and accuracy sensing capability. Results from calibration experiment are presented, which proved that the proposed sensor design produced comparable turbidity readings as that of a commercial turbidity sensor.},
